A stylish retro 3D printable case to turn the Amiga 600 into a 4 player gaming console

The AMIGAbox - a modern retro console case to turn a Commodore Amiga 600 into a 4 player gaming console.

I had a dead Amiga 600 board that I managed to fix ... but without a case, a keyboard and a floppy. So I thought ...what can I do with a naked board? The answer: Build something cool and modern but still retro. I fired up TinkerCad and designed a new case. The goal was to make a living room compatible 4 player gaming console with built in games.

And that is what I ended up with:

- Amiga 600 with Kickstart 1.3 ROM for max. compatibility
- RGB2HDMI for HDMI video out
- 4-Player adapter built in (PCB from PCBway shared projects)
- GOTEK drive with rotary and OLED display

Looks best when printed in Resin.
